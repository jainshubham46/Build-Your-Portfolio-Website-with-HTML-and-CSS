4.Question 4
Which of these statements about hyperlinks in HTML is INCORRECT?


Hyperlinks in HTML are specified with the anchor tag <a>


ANS :- Hypertlinks can only jump to another local file on the same server.


The destination for the hyperlink is specified with the href attribute of the anchor tag <a>.


The text for the hyperlink anchor can be formatted using CSS

Correct
This is incorrect and therefore is the right answer. Hyperlinks can jump to a local file (like we did with resume.html) or files that are located on an external server, (like we did with GitHub.com).


5.Question 5
The relationship between HTML and CSS is best described as:


They are unrelated.


CSS specifies contents and HTML specifies formats and styles.

Correct!


6.Question 6

<p><h2>Table of Contents</h2></p>


ANS:- <p><h2>Table of Contents</p></h2>


<h2><a href="toc.html">Table of Contents</h2>


<h2>Table of Contents</h2>

7.Question 7
How do you apply a stylesheet to an HTML file?


Use a link tag in the footer section of the HTML file:

<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/master.css">


ANS :- Use a link tag in the header section of the HTML file:

<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/master.css">


Put the stylesheet file in the same directory as the HTML file and use the same file name but with a .css extension.


You list all the HTML files that the stylesheet applies to at the top in the stylesheet file.

Correct
Correct!


8.Question 8
What does this CSS code do when applied to an HTML file?

body {

color: black;

}

h1 {

color: red;

}


It turns the background color of all the level 1 headers text red.


This is invalid and has no effect. The correct attribute is font-color.


This is invalid because we already specified the font color of the body to be black and it cannot be redefined for h1.


ANS :- It turns all the level 1 header text red.

Correct
Correct! The font color black would have cascaded to h1 but we overrode it with the color red in h1.

9.Question 9
Which of the following statement is true regarding font specification in CSS?


Fixed pitch font such as Courier cannot used to render web pages.


PC and Mac typically have the same fonts installed.


You should never specify a particular font by name. You should only use font family names and let the browser pick the closest font in that family that is installed in the client machine.


ANSI:- t is not possible to know whether a client machine has the font that we desire installed.

Correct
Correct! Therefore we specify a list in order of preferences for the web browser client to fall back on.


10.Question 10
What does the alt= attribute in an HTML image tag <img> do?


ANS :-It tells the browser to display a piece of text in place of an image in case it cannot be found or loaded.


It tells the browser to display an alternative image in place of an image in case it cannot be found or loaded.


It tells the browser the alternative location of an image in case it cannot be found or loaded.


It tells the browser to alternate the image with another one randomly for each client request.

Correct
Correct!
